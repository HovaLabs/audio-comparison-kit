      Over the last few months we've been working on Version 4 of The Hovalin.
      The biggest change from previous versions is that the chamber body is now a single piece.
      Previously, the chamber was made up of 3 major pieces and 2 joints.
      We were ecstatic when we heard how much better the new version sounded. Not to mention how much more solid it was and how much easier it was to assemble.
      In a quest to find out if we could make the Hovalin sound <em>even better</em> we started to tune some of features.
      In this blog we're going to talk about the following:
